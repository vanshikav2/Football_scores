# Analysis of Football Match Results Using Poisson Regression

## Overview

This repo contains the paper that presents a predictive modeling approach for forecasting football match outcomes using Poisson regression. The study explores the application of Poisson regression, a widely used statistical method, to analyze football match data and predict the number of goals scored by each team. By considering various factors such as team performance metrics, home advantage, and match statistics, the model aims to provide insights into the likelihood of different match outcomes.
